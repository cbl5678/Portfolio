        <p>This game takes place on April 14th, 1993. It is based on a water-tap in the Atlantic
            Ocean that never stopped runnning. "The Things We Lost In The Flood" is a fairly basic
            game that follows one main character. You will explore the flooded, apocalyptic, world
            on a simple row boat.</p>
        <!--insert conrols and paddle img-->
        <div class=flex>
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/controls.png" alt="" />
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/paddle.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>When launching the game, you get introduced to your character and the basic controls. You
            will use "W, A, S, D" to move and "Spacebar" to paddle. As your character, you paddle in
            your boat across many different scenes but with very little instruction.</p>
        <!--Insert Scene 1, 2, 3 img-->
        <div class=flex>
            <img class=three src="pictures/gamePics/scene1.png" alt="" />
            <img class=three src="pictures/gamePics/scene2.png" alt="" />
            <img class=three src="pictures/gamePics/scene3.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>The setting of the game is also quite basic, as you can see. The graphics are in an 8-bit
            style so objects and scenery aren't easily recognizable. You do however get the basics
            that you're a character in this flooded world that needs to <i>paddle</i>..</p>
        <p>With very little instruction, you just start paddling and exploring this new world on
            your own. After Paddling through a few scenes, you may notice a bottle floating in the
            water. The game instructs you to pick up said bottle by pressing the "E" Key. When a
            bottle is picked up, you are given a message to read.</p>
        <!--insert message img--><div class=flex>
            <img class=one src="pictures/gamePics/message.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>This is where the game starts to come together for the player. Throughout the whole game
            there are these bottles with messgaes in them, which are written by other players. These
            messages could be helpful in figuring out what direction to take the game, but the
            messages could also be completely useless since they are left by other players including
            yourself. Furthermore, as a player, you can decide to throw any message you come across
            back into the water for other players to endure, or you can destroy the message. </p>
        <!--insert blank note and first note img--><div class=flex>
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/blankNote.png" alt="" />
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/firstNote.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>The more you <i>paddle</i> the more interaction you have with things in this world. There
            are these spider type creatures that you can defeat while on your travels. When you beat
            these spider creatures, they drop these "disks" that you collect. Soon you find out you
            can also deposit these disks in certain areas which may also give you parts to upgrade
            your boat. </p>
        <!--insert spider img--><div class=flex>
            <img class=one src="pictures/gamePics/spider.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <!--insert cube and cubeLetter img--><div class=flex>
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/cube.png" alt="" />
            <img class=two src="pictures/gamePics/cubeLetter.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>From this point in the game and on, the gameplay is pretty much up to you. You choose
            what to interact with and how the gameplay continues. The game is a lot more involved
            than it appears to be. Playing through the game once or even a couple times, one may not
            come across all the content within the game. After numerous clicks on my spacebar I came
            across a scene that I haven't came across before. It was the end... The scene consisted
            of paddling your boat up onto an island where there is a cross. This leaves the players
            to believe this is the end.</p>
        <div class=flex>
            <img class=one src="pictures/gamePics/end.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>"The Things We Lost In The Flood" is a fun, interactive game. Although the game has basic
            graphics, there is still a great deal of challenge. The player must play the game and
            learn as they go with the potential help from other players if they happen to leave you
            a nice little messagae. You get to see this apocalyptic, flooded world for how the
            player wants. Although the game is more passive, there is a story the player creates for
            themselves. One truly gets a sense of interaction and control when playing this game. I
            would most certainly play this game over multiple times to see if it entails anything
            else.</p>
