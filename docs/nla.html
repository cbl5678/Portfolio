            <p class="intro"> My analysis will be between some text files from the years 1965
                through 1975. The comparative element in this analysis will be that one set of files
                is from new articles, and the other set of files is from magazines. I will be
                looking at Keywords In Context, N-grams and clusters. To do so, i will use the two
                tools, Antconc and Voyant. Below are my findings. </p>

                        will see the most common used words in COHA News articles from 1965-1975.
                        When excluding words like "said" and "mr." the most common word in this file
                        set is: </p>

                    <p class="info">I believe, "President," is the most common word used because the
                        News text files are either talking about or addresing the President.
                        President's Johnson, Nixon, and Ford were the three active presidents during
                        the time period of 1965-1975.</p>

                        text files, it is best to scope anywhere from 5-8 words on each side of the
                        word in context. When I went lower than 5, it wasnt really enough context to
                        help determine what thes texts are trying to tell me. When going above 8,
                        there were minimal hits.</p>
                    <p class="info">From what one can tell from this image, is that these news
                        articles talk about various President's from different organizations,
                        President Johnson, and President Nixon. Vietnam is briefley mentioned. The
                        president of Egypt at the time, Gamal Nasser, is also mentioned due to the
                        time period of these files being around two separate Arab-Israeli wars. This
                        particular text file talking about Nasser was from the "6 Days of War" in
                        1967.</p>

                        about the politics, but I learned much more about these text files after
                        scoping them.</p>
                    <p class="info">The News talked about events happening around the world and how
                        it was being dealt with. Like the mentionings of all the US presidents and
                        even the President of Egypt at the time.</p>
                    <p class="info">The magazines seemed to have more interview based content. A lot
                        of what I read during the KWIC scoping was that it was made up of alot of
                        dialogue.</p>
                    <p class="info">Although these groups of text files are different, when using
                        NLA and the right tools, one can find that there is alot more to a set of
                        text than one may originally percieve. These tools allow deep searches of
                        text with the use of context.</p>
